<p>GTimeLog is a small Gtk+ app for keeping track of your time.  Its
main goal is to be as unintrusive as possible.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>Here's how it works: every day, when you arrive to work, start up gtimelog
and type "arrived".  Then start doing some activity (e.g. reading mail, or
working on a task).  Whenever you stop doing an activity (either when you have
finished it, or when you switch to working on something else), type the name of
the activity into the gtimelog prompt.  Try to use the same text if you make
several entries for an activity (history helps here&mdash;just use the up and down
arrow keys).  They key principle here is to name the activity after you've
stopped working on it, and not when you've started.  Of course you can type the
activity name upfront, and just delay pressing the Enter key until you're done.
</p>

<p>There are two broad categories of activities: ones that count as work (coding,
planning, writing proposals or reports, answering work-related email), and ones
that don't (browsing the web for fun, reading personal email, chatting with
a friend on the phone for two hours, going out for a lunch break).  To indicate
which activities are not work related add two asterisks to the activity name:
<p>

<blockquote><pre>
lunch **
browsing slashdot **
napping on the couch **
</pre></blockquote>

If you want some activity (or non-activity) to be completely omitted from the
reports, use three asterisks (this works only in GTimeLog 0.2.1 or later):

<blockquote><pre>
break ***
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
GTimeLog displays all the things you've done today, and calculates the total
time you spent working, and the total time you spent "slacking".  It also
advises you how much time you still have to work today to get 8 hours of work
done.  There are two basic views: one shows all the activities in chronological
order, with starting and ending times; while another groups all entries with
the same into one activity and just shows the total duration.
</p>

<p>
At the end of the day you can send off a daily report by choosing Report -&gt; Daily
Report.  A mail program (Mutt in a terminal, unless you have changed it in
~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc or ~/.config/gtimelog/gtimelogrc) will be started with
all the activities listed in it.  My Mutt configuration lets me edit the report
before sending it.
</p>

<p>
If you make a mistake and type in the wrong activity name, or just forget to
enter an activity, don't worry.  GTimeLog stores the time log in a simple plain
text file ~/.gtimelog/timelog.txt (or ~/.local/share/gtimelog/timelog.txt).
Every line contains a timestamp and the name of the activity that was finished
at the time.  All other lines are ignored, so you can add comments if you want
to&mdash;just make sure no comment begins with a timestamp.  You do not have to
worry about GTimeLog overwriting your changes&mdash;GTimeLog always appends
entries at the end of the file, and does not keep the log file open all the
time.  You do have to worry about overwriting changes made by GTimeLog with
your editor&mdash;make sure you do not enter any activities in GTimeLog while
you have timelog.txt open in a text editor.

<h2>Downloading</h2>

<p>There is a gtimelog package in <a
  href="http://packages.debian.org/gtimelog">Debian</a> and in <a
  href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/gtimelog">Ubuntu</a>.  You probably won't
get the latest version this way, thought.</p>

<p>The latest release is available from the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gtimelog">Python
Package Index</a>.  You can <code>pip install gtimelog</code>.</p>

<p>You will also need <a href="http://www.python.org">Python
  2.7 (or 3.3+)</a> and <a href="http://www.pygtk.org">PyGtk</a>.</p>

<p>GTimeLog should also work on Windows and Mac OS X, but I don't have convenient
installers.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>When you run GTimeLog the first time, it will create a configuration file
(~/.gtimelog/gtimelogrc) with the default settings.  Edit it to set your name
and other settings.  You'll need to restart GTimeLog for the changes to take
effect.  A sane configuration dialog is <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/gtimelog/+bug/220766">planned
  for some future version</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>
